# Satellite Tracker

> Powered by THREE.js, Next.js 14, with blazing fast speed (sort of..) ðŸ˜Ž

This is a small project when I am working on my Lab Project, which is making a satellite tracker to be displayed on a big screen.
This project was inspired by [satellite tracker 3d](https://satellitetracker3d.com/) which definitely need to check out because it it so cool.

## Features

- Fully controlled: No third party library, just pure THREE.js.
- Cached Sat Data: The satellite data is cached in the server, so it will not be calculated every time the page is loaded.
- Controllable line thickness: You can control the line thickness of the satellite orbit.

## TODO

- Use Point cloud to render the satellite instead of using a sphere.
- Add interactive control to the satellite.
